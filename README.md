# helix Android Wallet

Welcome to the helix Wallet for android! Its a work in progress forked from [pivx](pivx-android).

This project contains several sub-projects:

- app: The Android app itself. This is probably what you're searching for.
- helixmore: Mix of unused stratum protocol and some wallet code.

You can build all sub-projects at once using Gradle:

    gradle clean build
